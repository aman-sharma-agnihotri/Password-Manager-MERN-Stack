# Password Manager 

 ## Password Manager using React, Tailwindcss, MongoDB, Express, Node!

I built a Full Stack Password Manager Web Application using the MERN Stack

Over the past few days, I worked on creating a fully functional Password Manager web app as a personal project to strengthen my MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) stack skills.

## 🔧 Technologies Used:

**Frontend:** React.js with Hooks (useState, useEffect, useRef), TailwindCSS for responsive and modern UI

**Backend:** Node.js and Express.js for REST API routes and server-side logic

**Database:** MongoDB for storing password entries

**Tools/Libraries:** UUID for unique identifiers, Toastify for user feedback, and the Clipboard API for copying data securely

## ✅ Key Features:

**Add, Edit, Delete Passwords:** Each password entry (site, username, password) is stored in MongoDB with a unique ID.

**Copy to Clipboard:** Users can copy site URLs, usernames, or passwords directly to their clipboard with a single click.

**Show/Hide Password Toggle:** Improves user experience with basic privacy features using icons.

**Clean UI:** Built using TailwindCSS with mobile responsiveness.

**Persistent Storage:** Data is stored and retrieved in real-time from MongoDB through API calls.

**Edit Mode:** When editing a password, the old entry is deleted and the new one is saved with a new ID—ensuring simple state management.

## 🔍 What I Learned:
How to integrate a complete front-end React application with a Node/Express API.

CRUD operations using RESTful APIs and MongoDB.

Designing a clean and functional UI using TailwindCSS.

How to handle real-time form updates and state changes effectively using React.

Managing user experience with visual feedback through Toast notifications.

Efficient debugging and error-handling during full-stack development.
